## Exercises
Inside the folder `exercises` are the solutions to the exercises listed here. Everyone who aims to pratice Python or any other language can use this list of exercises.

### The Zen of Python
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

```
python 000.py
```

### Hello World
Simplest and first code of universe!
Texts are always enclosed in quotation marks.

```
python 001.py
```

### Input and Print
Varible gets an input refered on console by the phrase enclosed in quotation marks '' or "".
Inputs are always str type.
Print function prints on console.

```
python 002.py
```

### Math Operators
Variables x and y gets a number input as string (str), and int() transform it into integer number.
Order of mathematical operations:
  1. ()
  2. **
  3. * , / , // , and %
  4. + , -

```
python 003.py
```

### Extract Information
Extracting some information about variable 'object'.

```
python 004.py
```

### Read and Print Integers
Make a script that reads a integer number and prints its predecessor and successor.

```
python 005.py
```

### Double, Triple and Square Root
Make an algoritm that reads a number and prints its double, triple and square root.

```
python 006.py
```

### Calculate Average
Make a code that reads the grades of a student, and calculate this mean.

```
python 007.py
```

### Temperature Converter
Make a script that reads a temperature in Celsius degree and returns the temperature into Fahrenheits degree.

```
python 008.py
```

### Mathematical Table
Make a script that reads any integer number, and returns its mathematical table.

```
python 009.py
```

### Currency Converter
Make a script that converts dollars into bitcoin.

```
python 010.py
```

## Fluent Python
Inside the folder `fluent_python` are some examples of book ![Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming-ebook-dp-B0131L3PW4/dp/B0131L3PW4/ref=mt_kindle).

Book's abstract:

"Python’s simplicity lets you become productive quickly, but this often means you aren’t using everything it has to offer. With this hands-on guide, you’ll learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best—and possibly most neglected—features. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through Python’s core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time.

Many experienced programmers try to bend Python to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover Python features outside of their experience. With this book, those Python programmers will thoroughly learn how to become proficient in Python 3.

This book covers:

* Python data model: understand how special methods are the key to the consistent behavior of objects
* Data structures: take full advantage of built-in types, and understand the text vs bytes duality in the Unicode age
* Functions as objects: view Python functions as first-class objects, and understand how this affects popular design patterns
* Object-oriented idioms: build classes by learning about references, mutability, interfaces, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance
* Control flow: leverage context managers, generators, coroutines, and concurrency with the concurrent.futures and asyncio packages
* Metaprogramming: understand how properties, attribute descriptors, class decorators, and metaclasses work"
